# GifItUp

---

A web based game inspired by Cards Against Humanity and What Do You Meme. The game uses gifs or images pulled from the Giphy API as the "playing cards".  


### TODO
**The project is still in its infancy and has significant work to be done.**<br>

The major goals in the near future are...
- Setting up the functionality for a round-based game set up
    - passing role of 'judge' after a round concludes
    - incrementing score of the player whose card is chosen by the judge
    - displaying each player's score in the sidebar
- Creating a link to the current game "room" when a game is initialized
- Overall UI/UX to go from no styling to presentable

### About the project

- Built using ReactJS, NodeJS and socket.io
- Images and gifs pulled from the Giphy API
